# POWERPLAY
FIRST Tech Challenge sample programs for the POWERPLAY season.

- Cam1.java - Autonmous program that uses Tensorflow to detect the signal and then drives to the indicated Signal Zone.
- Cam2.java - Autonmous program that uses Tensorflow with a custom sleeve and user created Tensorflow model to detect the signal and then drives to the indicated Signal Zone.
- TeleOp1.java - A basic point of view driving program for a holonomic drive robot.
- Tensor1.java - The default "concept" Tensorflow program that detects the signal cone using a webcam.
- Tensor2.java - A copy of Tensor1 but modified to detect the custom sleeve on the signal cone.
- Vuforia1.java - The default "concep" Vurforia program that detects this years navigation targets using a webcam.
- VuforiaBlue1.java - This autonomous program simply drives to the nearest ground junction to place a cone there. (Does not use Vuforia).
- VuforiaBlue2.java - This autonomous programs uses Vuforia to re-align the robot while it drives to the stack of blue cones.
